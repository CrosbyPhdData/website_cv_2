        <h4>Data Specialist in the Property-Technology (Proptech) Industry and Founder of <a href="https://www.ai-owl.co.uk">AI Owl Limited</a>.</h4>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. It is my pleasure to support the very exciting UK real estate sector. With the right data, information and expertise, the UK property markets can prove to be very profitable. I became aware of this more
          than ever once I had completed my Ph.D. thesis on UK residential house price prediction. <br><br>
          Since then I have heavily contributed to a number of leading UK proptech web portals as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data and Technology Manager and Associate Director. Over the past year, I started to see market, process and
          technological patterns emerging and I felt that I was ready to make my expertise, technology and complex data techniques more accessible to the whole sector. Hence I created AI Owl, a company who bases success on offering the right property
          or technology expertise for each job undertaken - after all, it is the right people and the right skills that will allow us to stay valuable to our clients. <br><br>
          I would love to chat about any ideas that you may have and will always be honest about costs and my technical alignment to the project as early as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
